# README

This is a repository containing various analysis scripts for my projects. The scripts are separated into subdirectories associated with `sbndcode` versions.

My main projects include:

- electron-neutrino charged-current selection
- light-related studies, such as charge-light likelihood (Q->L) and light calorimetry (Q+L)
- flash-matching (`OpT0Finder`)
- WireCell validation and analysis
  - signal processing, imaging, and validation of `wct` (WireCell Toolkit) and `larwirecell`

There is also a subdirectory, `helper` that contains python files with helper functions.
